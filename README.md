### Hi there 👋

Nice to meet you. I am an enthusiastic software engineer passionate about collaborating with like-minded individuals to transform ideas into impactful code. 

- ✍ I [write about code](https://alondahari.github.io/) somewhat irregularly.
- 🔭 I’m currently working at GitHub on the issues and projects team.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything exciting, especially rust projects. I love improving developer experience.
- 💬 Ask me about TypeScript, RoR, Coding principals, or how to parallel park on a busy street.
